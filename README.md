In this section I am replicating a study by David Card and Alan B. Krueger and R tutorial by Philipp Leppert about the effect of a raise in minimum wages on employment. Conventional economic theory suggests that in a labour market with perfect competition an increase in the minimum wage leads to an increase in unemployment. (Ref:https://rpubs.com/phle/r_tutorial_difference_in_differences)

Card and Krueger (1994) use a DID approach and show that this increase in minimum wages led to an increase in employment in the sector of fast food restaurants, contrary to the convention economic theory. 

Intervention (treatment) group: in April 1992, the U.S. state of New Jersey (NJ) raised the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05. Control group: ithe neighbouring U.S. state of Pennsylvania (PA), which was not subject to this policy change. 

Panel data: the authors conducted a survey before and after the raise of the minimum wage with a representative sample of fast food restaurants in NJ and PA. This setting can be regarded as quasi-experimental, as both states are not identical in many aspects and the legislative procedure, in order the raise the minimum wage, was not initiated at random.


Research question:
Does the increase in minimum wages lead to an increase in unemployment in the sector of fast food restaurants in the context of the new wage policy in New Jersey? A quasi-experimental study
